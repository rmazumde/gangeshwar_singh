Gangeshwar Singh entered the IPS in 1987 (West Bengal cadre) after clearing the UPSC examination with Hindi Literature as an optional subject. Growing up amid the forests and rivers of Palamu honed his endurance and empathy—qualities that shaped his police career.

He balances administrative leadership with hands-on engagement, often working directly with communities during crises. The professional rigor of policing feeds his writing, and his literary sensitivity informs his approach to justice.
