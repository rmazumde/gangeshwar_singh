Born in Meral, Palamu, and educated in Medininagar, Gangeshwar Singh drew early nourishment from nature and from poets like Sur, Tulsi, Rahim, Jayasi, Kabir, Raskhan, Nirala, and Pant. Imagination, dreams, and reality collided as he prepared for the UPSC and entered the IPS in 1987 with Hindi Literature as an optional subject.

He writes through the humdrum of duty: poems, prose, essays, and dance-dramas flow from the same commitment that guides his public service. Service across West Bengal—including the intense pandemic years—deepened his empathy for the oppressed and the mechanisms of law and order.

Writing is not optional. It is passion and oxygen: a way to honor ancestral land, to capture contradictions he witnesses daily, and to stay rooted in compassion.
