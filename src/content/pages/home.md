Born on February 16, 1962 at Meral Village in Palamu (Jharkhand), Gangeshwar Singh grew up on the confluence of two rocky rivers—nature’s cradle that shaped his temperament. Palamu is called Nature’s Cradle for a reason: hills, rivers, and forests shaped his sense of wonder. Literature, music, and painting fascinated him early. Sur, Tulsi, Rahim, Jayasi, Kabir, Raskhan, Nirala, and Pant became his teachers, and he composed poems inspired by them.

He studied locally—primary school in Meral, Higher Secondary and Graduation from Medininagar—before clearing the UPSC exam and joining the IPS (West Bengal cadre) in 1987 with Hindi Literature as an optional. Service and writing have always walked together. Even in the humdrum of duty he kept crafting poems, essays, dance-dramas, and lyrics in Hindi and Bengali. Writing is oxygen: a way to honour the land that raised him and the people he serves.
